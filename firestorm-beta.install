From the latest inworld Firestorm group notice:
* This is pre-release quality, bugs are to be expected, reporting them when found is also expected.
* These viewers are not supported by the regular support channels.
  - Wiki pages may not correspond to the UI and function that you see.
  - The support groups for the release viewer will ask you to revert to the release viewer if you report an issue there.
* These builds are blocked regularly when out of date. They are also preset with a hard extinction date.
* Share the page freely, but do not share the links.
  - For the reasons stated, it is far better that people stop clicking on links inworld and downloading software. By sharing a legitimate link you are still encouraging poor discipline, this is why we have ceased to do that and it is why I ask that you do too.
  - As people learn that all such links are to be considered suspect, people found to be sharing links may find that they get AR'd, rightly or wrongly.
